# 6. Extensions

There are several third party libraries that expand the functionality of Akka Http.

Among those, we want to highlight the following:

- [akka-http-json](https://github.com/hseeberger/akka-http-json): Integrate some of the best JSON libs in Scala with Akka HTTP
- [swagger-akka-http](https://github.com/swagger-akka-http/swagger-akka-http): A Scala/Java library for generating Open API (a.k.a. Swagger) from annotated Akka HTTP code
- [Guardrail](https://github.com/twilio/guardrail): Guardrail is a code generation tool, capable of reading from OpenAPI/Swagger specification files and generating Akka HTTP code
- [akka-http-session](https://github.com/softwaremill/akka-http-session): Web & mobile client-side akka-http sessions, with optional JWT support
- [sttp](https://github.com/softwaremill/sttp): Library that provides a clean, programmer-friendly API to define HTTP requests and execute them using one of the wrapped backends, akka-http among them.

See the Scala Index for a more in-depth [list of them](https://index.scala-lang.org/search?topics=akka-http).
